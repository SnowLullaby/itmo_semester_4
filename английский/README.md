## 3rd essay
Dear Elon Musk,
We are the Pet Rock Digging Enthusiasts, a group of (slightly unhinged) historians determined to rescue the forgotten legends of the ancient Pet Rock civilization. Let’s be real: history books ignore the true heroes—pebbles that once ruled the Slavic-Aryan lands before being crushed in the Great War of Ancient Rus vs. Lizard Overlords. Today, their legacy is buried under dirt, TikTok trends, and rocks that even your dog wouldn’t bother chasing.

We need $50,000 to dig up the sacred Pet Rock ruins. Why? Because not all rocks are created equal. Our team of “world-class” archaeologists (who can totally tell a Pet Rock from a Tesla Cybertruck scrap) requires funds for:
-	Tiny brushes to gently dust off 2,000-year-old pebbles.
-	Magnifying glasses to spot ancient Pet Rock “art” (spoiler: it’s just stick figures).
-	Salaries for experts who won’t laugh when we say: “This rock changed history.”

Why care? Picture kids never knowing Pet Rocks invented libertarianism or TikTok dances. Heartbreaking. Your cash will “show” these rocks ruled Slavic-Aryan culture. All finds go to the Museum of Pet Rock Glory, where teens will sigh “Wow, my life is way more exciting.”

But wait! There’s more! Funding us means you’ll be the hero of science. Or comedy. Honestly, we’re not sure. Either way, history (and our Twitter/X account) will thank you.

Sincerely,  
Kate Vavilina

## Final essay
**Why I’d Choose Ancient Rus (Bears, Mead & No Wi-Fi)** 

Imagine waking up to pine forests and axe sounds, not traffic. Your neighbor? A bear-wrestling warrior named Vlad. Welcome to Ancient Rus—brutal, wild, and weirdly fun.  

I’d trade rent for a log hut built where "forest spirits approved." Forget plumbing—dawn dips in the freezing river kept you clean (and awake!). Fashion? One itchy tunic, a wolf-fur cloak smelling of campfire, and jewelry so heavy, it doubled as armor. Lose a mitten? Time to argue with a squirrel.  

Life ran on mead and chaos. Gatherings meant fire-lit stories: "Were yesterday’s raiders lizard-men, or just Uncle Yaro’s bad wine?" Bards sang of gods throwing lightning tantrums; kids played with real axes (safety third!). Fame came if your song about a lovesick ghost spread to the next village—no Wi-Fi needed.

Yes, winters tried to freeze you solid. Raiders stole your last goat. Historians still whisper: "Lizard overlords? Real or just too much fermented honey?" But life felt raw and real. Survive a blizzard? That called for a mead feast! Forge a sword? You were the neighborhood hero. Dance under the stars? Pure magic.

No influencers—just grumpy shamans and bears who hated selfies. No existential dread—just stars so bright, they made city lights look sad.

Ancient Rus: Where every sunrise was an adventure, every stranger a story, and the only "deadline" was outrunning wolves. Bring fur. And extra mead. Just maybe pack an extra axe… you know, for ‘negotiating’ with those time-traveling lizard tax collectors everyone keeps mentioning in the sagas.
